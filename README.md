# sweet_pink_hass_theme

Theme for home assistant that makes use of pinks and purples and maybe some teal

# WIP

Stay tuned for more customizations, fancy javascript, and maybe even a background

# HACS

Trying to get this into HACS, still new to this whole ecosystem and not sure how yet

# Installation

Literally you can just grab the YAML file and put it in your themes folder. If you put it there via git, you can get upstream updates. If you install via HACS, you get them automatically. But it's just a little bit of CSS.

# Extensions

There's a lot of custom cards out there now that use their own classes and styles, PRs are welcome!

# Vibe

Hacker Elite meets Moog Synths meets Miami Vice tempered towards a masculine understanding of the feminine
